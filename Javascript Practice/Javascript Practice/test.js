// We used console.log() to print out any statement towards the user to see in the Developer Console section tab when they inspect the web browser. Try it out!

// Practice using let variable types and printing them out.

// Notice in the developer console tab in the webpage, when you inspect the int variable show up as green.

// Practice with const. Const variables are used for when we don't want or need to reassign a variable ever, even if its changed later. If it is changed, the code will throw an error as shown in the example below.

const Pi = 3.14; // Declare const variable
// Pi = 10; // Try to reassign it and print it out on the console. This is commented out by default as it will prevent future tasks from running.
console.log(Pi);
// An error message should shown in the developer console tab in the webpage when inspecting this output.


// Practice doing equations and printing in the console.log(function) form The Odin Project lessons.
