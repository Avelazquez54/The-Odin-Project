     <p>The text color of this entire paragraph will be red to demonstrate the color property in the styles.css file.</p>


     <div class="subtext">
        <p>The text color here is green due to the div class deciding the color for the text used in this section. Carefully monitor how the structure is for this paragraph in the Styles.css file as since this is still a p type tag, it can still claim attributes from the inital p css attributes from the pargraph above </p>
     </div>
     
     <div class="test">
        <p>As demonstrated here, this paragraph takes the text color from the first paragraph above despite it being inside a div class itself. This is due to the fact that because its p type and not p1,p2, etc, it will still be using the p css attributes used in Styles.css.</p>
